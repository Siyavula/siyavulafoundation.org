The Kaizen, INSEAD and NYU Stern Education Symposium (KINSES) - 2016 “Global Trends; Local Realities”
was held on the 27th and 28th of February 2016 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The event is described as "a thought leadership symposium on trends, opportunities and challenges in education" with a strong focus on creating opportunities for global networking and showcasing business models to successfully reach global audiences.

#### EduAwards

Prior to the symposium a competition was held to identify five promising start-ups in Asia and Africa that are disrupting the
education status quo with a mix of technology and innovative business models
and to recognize their efforts at the symposium.

We entered Siyavula Education into this competition and were selected
as one of the five <a href='http://kaizenpe.com/kinses2016/awards.php'>EduAward</a> winners. As a result, Mark Horner was able to attend
the symposium and present our business plan.

The award was for our work on <a href='/products-high-school.html'>Siyavula Practice</a>, our adaptive mathematics,
    physics and chemistry learning platform that enables an optimised
    practice-for-mastery experience. Our <a href='/technology-components.html'>technology page</a> explains the various
    components that go into making Siyavula Practice the learning tool that
    it is.

We were in good company with the other award winners being:
<ul>
    <li><a href='http://www.instafeez.com/'>Instafeez</a> – Pay Digital Technologies Pvt Ltd - Unified Payments,
    Communication, Commerce and Learning content aggregation solution</li>
    <li><a href='http://kidaptive.com/'>Kidaptive</a> - an adaptive learning
    platform.</li>
    <li><a href='http://kytabu.org/'>Kytabu</a> Company Limited - an app that
    allows learners to subscribe to publishers content.</li>
    <li><a href='https://www.vedantu.com/v/'>Vedantu</a> Innovations Pvt Ltd - an online, one-to-one tutoring solution.</li>
</ul>

#### EdTECH

We have been working very hard at Siyavula for the last three and a half years
and this was the first time we have entered a competition and the first time
that we have attended an education technology (edtech) event outside of local teacher
conferences in South Africa. This made it both a rewarding (pun intended) and
interesting experience.

It was good to meet some other startups from Africa and Asia as well as a
number of foundations and investors interested in edtech, specifically
in Africa. This was particularly timely as we have recently started exploring
how we might partner outside of South Africa to have an impact elsewhere in the
world.


#### Symposium

The <a href='http://kaizenpe.com/kinses2016/sessions.php'>symposium</a> consisted of excellent keynote presentations and many interesting
panels and selecting highlights was not easy. Nevertheless here are a few talks
or topics that resonated particularly strongly:

<dl>
<dt>Peter Peter Blair Henry, Dean, Leonard N. Stern School of Business</dt>
<dd>Peter unpacked the impact that the developing world will have on the global
labour force. The numbers are quite incredible and, while tertiary
qualifications are always in demand, the greatest need in the developing world
is for quality secondary education. One particular point that stood out was
modeling how quickly the standard of living can double in a country. The
precise number depends on population growth etc. but it drove home clearly the
point that real progress in South Africa is possible in a relatively short time
frame if we approach the challenges properly. Fixing education can really have
a massive impact - not overnight but in a decade.</dd>


<dt>Dr. Jorg Drager, Member of the Executive Board, Bertelsmann Stiftung</dt>
<dd>This was by far my favourite talk as Jorg was able to sketch a beautifully
insightful, simple and clear picture of the education system, the opportunities
and trends in technology, the challenges to implementation and bring it back to
real world basics. Often it seems like working in education is impossibly messy
and it is reassuring to have our work affirmed in a clear overview of the
sector. If you have the opportunity to hear him speak, we highly recommend you
do so.</dd>


<dt>Investment in Africa</dt>
<dd>There was consensus on few points at the symposium but one point that
seemed to be accepted by all was that there is a dearth of investors prepared
to invest between $1M and $5M in the African context and this was hampering
many organisations and companies in their scaling up.</dd>


<dt>Blended learning</dt>
<dd>The panel on blended learning took the opportunity to define blended
learning as requiring streaming video which I thought was quite unfortunate and pretty much
rules out a whole host of countries benefitting from blended learning in the
near future. The panel was dominated by video lesson platforms and providers
but the opportunity to challenge this and to look for innovation beyond video
streaming was missed. </dd>
</dl>

On the whole it was a very interesting symposium and Siyavula Education will
benefit massively from the exposure and the connections we made.
