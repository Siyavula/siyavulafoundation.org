Implementing a new strategy, teaching practice or technology into the classroom can be exciting, but also challenging and time consuming. We recognise and appreciate this. Which is why we have recently put together a set of ideas and guidelines on how to effectively use Intelligent Practice, both in and out of the classroom.

#### The research and ideas behind the effective use of Intelligent Practice
Our aim is to constantly build, develop and create learning and teaching experiences that are grounded in the latest cognitive science research. For this reason, you will find reading the [Taking Action](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz69EszGvRvaUnVqeTlmdWNYSW8/view?usp=sharing) ideas, both enlightening on research and best practices for ***mastery-based learning***, and then how an ***adaptive technology service***, Intelligent Practice, enables teachers and learners to more easily take advantage of and implement these practices in Maths and Science.

This series of **six use cases** provides you with some insight and assistance in the following:

- Are you interested in the **science and research** behind the program, and why it works the way it does?
- Are you wondering how to **motivate** learners and explain to them why **regular** practice is important?
- For those who are fairly new to Intelligent Practice, you will find more guidelines about **where and how to start** e.g. how it can be implemented both inside and outside the classroom.
- You may be looking to support your learners with more **focused revision sessions**.
- You may be looking for ideas about how to go about implementing active, blended learning in the classroom, and initiating further examples such as collaborative learning or peer-to-peer learning.
- Or do you want more insight into the powerful diagnostic tool that is your **Teacher's Dashboard** and how you can more effectively use the data?

The following table provides a summary of each of the 6 use cases.
