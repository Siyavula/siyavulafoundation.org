The company also worked with local grant funders such as the Sasol Foundation to develop further free and open textbooks for Grades 4 - 9. With the increased traffic to the open online textbooks by students from low and no-fee public schools on their mobile phones, Siyavula began collaborating with local foundations to provide students with free access to the online practice software. In 2014, with an investment from the Silicon Valley-based group, Siyavula became part of the Omidyar Network (now Imaginable Futures), enabling the company to expand its offering, and opening up opportunities for international funders and partners.</p>

Siyavula Education and the Siyavula Foundation formed a strategic partnership to jointly seek to make both the software practice and open online textbooks freely available to students across Africa. 

Google.org was the first funder to support the newly formed Siyavula Foundation, funding the alignment and localisation of the software for the Nigerian curriculum. 

Siyavula Education initiated a grant-funded project with the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation, aimed at tailoring the solution to low-end public schools and provincial reporting, while migrating grant-funded projects to the Siyavula Foundation.</p>

In 2019, a partnership with MTN meant that we were able to offer free access to the practice platform for all Grade 10 - 12 Mathematics students in South Africa. During this time, use of the online textbooks grew to more than 1,8 million students a year, with more than 18 million questions delivered and marked on the practice platform, to more than 350 000 users. 

A partnership with the Mastercard Foundation in 2020 gave us the opportunity to launch a localised, curriculum-aligned free practice service to Rwandan S1 - S4 students, as a COVID-response initiative. More than one million questions were completed by Rwandan students within the first year.</p>
